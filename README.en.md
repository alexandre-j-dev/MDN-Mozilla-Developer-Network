<h1>Repository of exercises and documentation notes from MDN</h1>
This repository was created to present some of my personal studies and also a way to organize my files. These studies are from a series of tutorials for web developers taken from MDN Web Docs. The main tools learned are HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Learning at MDN has a strong focus on accessibility, optimization and more up-to-date methods of using these tools.

To browse the repository, just select the branch where you will have access to exercises (in english) and files. Each exercise contains the link to the original document. Thank you for your time and your reading!
