<h4>Task 1</h4> 
 Help to fill in the links on our Whales information page:
<ul>
  <li>The first link should be linked to a page called whales.html, which is in the same directory as the current page.</li>
  <li>We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.</li>   <li>The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as "whales@example.com".</li>
  <li>You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".</li>
</ul>

 <h4>Task 2</h4> 
 fill in the four links so that they link to the appropriate places:
<ul>
  <li>The first link should link to an image called blue-whale.jpg, which is located in a directory called blue inside the current directory.</li>
  <li>The second link should link to an image called narwhal.jpg, which is located in a directory called narwhal, which is located one directory level above the current directory.</li>   
  <li>The third link should link to the UK Google Image search. The base URL is https://www.google.co.uk, and the image search is located in a subdirectory called imghp.</li>
  <liThe fourth link should link to the paragraph at the very bottom of the current page. It has an ID of bottom.</li>
</ul>
