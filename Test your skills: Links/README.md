# The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to implement hyperlinks in HTML.

In this task, we want you to help fill in the links on our Whales information page:
<ul>
  <li>The first link should be linked to a page called whales.html, which is in the same directory as the current page.</li>
  <li>We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.</li>   <li>The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as "whales@example.com".</li>
  <li>You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".</li>
</ul>
